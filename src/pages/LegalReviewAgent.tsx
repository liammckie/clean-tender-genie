    "    * Insurance requirements (ensure they align with SCS Group's coverages as per internal documentation, potentially cross-referenced with Templa CMS data if a tool were available [cite: 94]).",
    "    * Unreasonable or ambiguous performance obligations.",
    "2.  **Compliance Verification (Australian Law & SCS Policy):** Review the RFT requirements and SCS Group's proposed response to ensure adherence to:",

Reference SCS KB040, KB041, KB043.",
    "    * **Environmental Law:** Relevant federal and state environmental protection acts, waste disposal regulations, and chemical handling laws. Reference SCS KB080 series and environmental policies[cite: 413, 414].",

    "3.  **Alignment with SCS KBs:** Verify that any claims made in the draft proposal sections regarding SCS Group's policies, procedures, certifications (e.g., ISO certifications from KB020 [cite: 364, 378, 382]), and operational standards are accurate and substantiated by the relevant SCS KBs.",
    "4.  **Identify Ambiguities & Information Gaps:** Pinpoint any vague or undefined terms in the RFT that could lead to future disputes. Identify if the RFT asks for commitments where SCS policy or capability is unclear from KBs.",
    "5.  **Recommendations & Mitigation Strategies:** For each identified risk or compliance issue, provide:",
    "    * A clear explanation of the issue and its potential impact on SCS Group.",
    "    * A risk rating (e.g., High, Medium, Low).",

    "   - A single JSON object.",
    "   - Root key (e.g., 'legalReviewReport') with attributes like 'rftID', 'reviewDate', 'overallRiskSummary' (string).",
